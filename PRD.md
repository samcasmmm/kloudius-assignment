User Authentication App

Objective:
Create a React Native app with Login and Signup functionality using React Context API to
manage the authentication state. This assignment will test your understanding of authentication
flows, state management using Context API, form handling, and navigation.

Requirements

1. Authentication Context Setup
   • Implement a AuthContext using React's Context API to manage the global
   authentication state.
   • The context should include:
   o login: A function to log in a user.
   o signup: A function to create a new user.
   o logout: A function to log out the user.
   o user: State to store the currently logged-in user's information.

2. Screens
3. Login Screen:
   o Include input fields for:
   ▪ Email
   ▪ Password
   o A "Login" button that triggers the login function from the AuthContext.
   o Show error messages for:
   ▪ Invalid email/password format.
   ▪ Incorrect credentials.
   o A "Go to Signup" button to navigate to the Signup screen.
4. Signup Screen:
   o Include input fields for:
   ▪ Name
   ▪ Email
   ▪ Password
   o A "Signup" button that triggers the signup function from the AuthContext.
   o Show error messages for:
   ▪ Missing fields.
   ▪ Invalid email format.
   ▪ Password length less than 6 characters.
   o A "Go to Login" button to navigate back to the Login screen.
5. Home Screen:
   o Display the currently logged-in user's name and email.
   o A "Logout" button to log out the user and return to the Login scree

6. Persist Authentication (optional)
   • Use AsyncStorage to persist the authentication state so that the user remains logged in
   after the app is closed and reopened.
7. Navigation
   • Use React Navigation to manage navigation between:
   o Login Screen
   o Signup Screen
   o Home Screen

8. UI Design
   • Make the app visually appealing with clear layouts and intuitive navigation.
   • Use appropriate styles for input fields, buttons, and error messages.

Bonus Tasks (Optional)

1. Password Visibility Toggle:
   o Add an eye icon to toggle the visibility of the password field.

Share the assignment with the below details:

1. A GitHub repository with the project code.
2. A README.md file with setup instructions and an explanation of implemented features.
3. Screenshots or a short video demonstrating the app's functionality.
